# STA410---Computational-Statistics-Winter 2023
Coursework

Synopsis/Assessment of Course:  
This course explores the computational methods, applications, and concerns associated with performing complex statistical analysis. It was one of my favorite courses at the University of Toronto (UofT), where I have taken 30 different courses, around 15 of which were at the 300-400 level.

The course was instructed by Scott Schwartz (Statistics), who, in my opinion, is the best professor I've had at UofT, except for Fabian Parsch (Mathematics). The format was engaging and conversational. Before lectures, students were expected to complete the readings and comprehend the material, allowing class time to deepen everyone's understanding through active dialogue. This was invaluable in fostering collaboration skills vital for scientific research. Unlike many classes at UofT that suffered from limited interactivity, this method energized learning, making the most out of in-class time.

I wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone who can enroll, although be warned, the amount of effort required is substantial.

NOTE: Future students should be aware that the course requires significant time to grasp the material and complete weekly homework. I will not post readings without permission from the professor, so please take this as a planning note. During my winter semester with 6 courses, this course demanded roughly 15 hours a week (4 hours - HW, 4-5 hours readings, 3 hours lectures, 3-6 hours studying) to excel.

Session: Winter 2023

Lecture time: Wednesday, 6pm-9pm

Textbook (Optional):

Computational Statistics (2009) - James E. Gentle
Computational Statistics (2013/2012) - Geof H. Givens, Jennifer A. Hoeting

Format of Assessments:

The course is co-hosted as a graduate course with different assessment weightings but identical material. Below are the weightings for the undergraduate version, which I took as an undergraduate student.

Best 7 out of 9 weekly homework Jupyter notebooks - 28% (My semester ended up being 6 out of 8)
2 coding challenges during 2 classes - 16% each, for a total of 32% (I was sick for the first challenge, so the weighting was shifted to the finals)
1 midterm - 20%
1 final - 20%

Topics:
WEEK 1 - Floating-Point, Pseudorandomness, Sampling, Integer Bit Representation, Modulus Recursion
WEEK 2 - Floating-Point Density, Numeric Errors, Tricks, Sum Roundoff Error, Catastrophic Cancellation
WEEK 3 - Singular Values, PCA/PCR, Condition,  Ax=b, Gram-Schmidt, Cholesky Factor Decomposition
WEEK 4 - Algorithmic Speed,  Xβ^≈y , Iterative Methods, Convolution Counting, Automatic Differentiation
WEEK 5 - Vector/Function Spaces, More on  Xβ^≈y , FFT, Interpolation, Radix-2 FFT Recursive Algorithm
WEEK 6 - Coding Challenge 1
WEEK 7 - Reading Week
WEEK 8 - Midterm
WEEK 9 - Optimization, Information, Variational Inference, Newton's Method, Fixed-Point Iteration Methods
WEEK 10 - Fisher Scoring, Non- L2  Loss, More Optimization, Iteratively Reweighted LS, nonlinear Gauss-Seidel	
WEEK 11 - Integral Approximation and Estimation, Sampling	
WEEK 12 - MCMC, Gibbs, Metropolis-Hastings, Hamiltonian	
WEEK 13 - Coding Challenge 2

NOTE: Some topics may not be listed as they were added per classroom discussions and might vary from year to year.
